# Workspace Controller

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

`@deepseek-ai/dsh-api-workspace-controller` owns the Host `ctx.workspaceController` service and the generated Client `ctx.remote.workspace` namespace. Its Remote methods create, rename, remove, and reorder Workspaces, reorder Sessions within a Workspace, archive Sessions from Workspace navigation, and follow the complete Workspace projection.

The Host controller serializes mutations whose correctness depends on current registry state and returns stable `WorkspaceError` values for expected failures. Its `follow()` stream synchronously attaches to durable Workspace changes, emits one complete baseline first, then emits ordered `upsert`, `remove`, `order`, and `archived` increments. A reconnect starts another generation with a replacement baseline, so consumers do not depend on receiving every increment while disconnected.

The Client entry provides `ClientWorkspaceModel` and `createWorkspaceStateStream()`. The model owns Workspace rows, registry order, archived Session ids, unary mutation echoes, and stream/unary race resolution. A newer Host row wins by `updatedAt`; a committed stream order outranks an older unary response; a removed Workspace id cannot be resurrected by delayed data. The package exposes framework-neutral snapshots and subscriptions, leaving navigation policy and React hooks to the UI owner.

## Model Experience

None, as Workspace organization is browser and Host control state and registers no prompt, tool, or session event.

#### KV Cache effect

No direct effect; Workspace mutations do not alter model requests.

## Known Limitations and Deferred Work

- `follow()` replaces the whole projection after reconnect and has no durable cursor or incremental catch-up protocol.
- Process-local deletion markers prevent delayed data from reviving a removed Workspace only for the lifetime of the Client model.
